Xenon is a Windows game that Max McGuire and Morgan McGuire wrote in 1995 during a one-week
winter vacation from high school and college, long before they were professional game
developers. This is the complete source code and assets for Visual Basic and the "registered"
version of the shareware distributable, which you may now use for free.

The user interface is custom coded to look like the (then new) Windows 95, but the code is
actually all 16-bit and runs on Windows 3.1 as well as newer versions.

It is inspired by Scorched Earth.
