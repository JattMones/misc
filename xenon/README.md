Xenon is a Windows game that Max McGuire and Morgan McGuire wrote in 1995 during winter
vacation from high school/college, long before they were professional game developers. This is
the complete source code and assets for Visual Basic and the "registered" version of the
shareware distributable, which you may now use for free.
